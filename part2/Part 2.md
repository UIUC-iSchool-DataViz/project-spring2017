### Part 2: Interactive, Bespoke Visualization

* ##### Approach
			
     We found relative distribution of grants in between states and cities, and analyzed them to find how it changed over the years.

* ##### Strengths of our approach

	We did a geospatial distribution. It gave us a clear understanding where grants were given

* ##### Weaknesses of our approach

We believe more research could have been done on related attributes to the data, for which we could find more relevant insights

* ##### Things we wish to have done

	We wished to have utilized FRED and GDP data, and other datasets.
