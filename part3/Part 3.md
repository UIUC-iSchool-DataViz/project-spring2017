### Part 3: System for Receiving New Data 

* ##### Approach
		
     We followed general visualization techniques to follow the quantitative fields. However, the data was randomized, so we couldnt find any useful insights

* ##### Strengths of our approach
		
     The visualizations we made gave some information about what could be.


* ##### Weaknesses of our approach

	The data we used is "flat". It is not normalized. 

* ##### Things we wish to have done
		
     If we had data that had been collected with a more practical approach.We could have used it to find more insights. 

* ##### Group contribution for each part of the visualization: 
     * Coding: Arpit, Sreeharsha
     * Data Management: Niteesh
     * Data Cleaning: Shivank
