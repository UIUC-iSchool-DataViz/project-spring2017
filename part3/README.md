Component 3: System for Receiving New Data

Concept: Given limited information about a dataset, what types of all-purpose visualizations can you construct to provide an overview of the data?

You will build a function which will either produce a visualization (either static or interactive) that provides an overview of the data. This may mean applying heuristics to the data to guess at different possible interesting characteristics. This function should accept a pandas dataframe.

The data will have at least eight columns:

Name
Date
Latitude, longitude
At least 1 Categorical label
At least 3 Quantitive columns

There will be three sample datasets provided.
