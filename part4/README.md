# LIS 590 Data Visualization Spring 2017 
## Component 4

This is the folder for Component 4 of *Group Summer*.

Infographic generated from CUMTD data visualization.

## Requirement: Narrative Report Around a Dataset

**Concept**: From the visualization you constructed in either component 1 or
component 2, construct a narrative.  You should take the visual output,
possibly modifying it (potentially with something like photoshop or gimp) to
fit the style of the rest of your text.

Your output should be in the form of an "infographic."  This should include the
visualization, narrative text, and should be designed to convey a *story* of
your own choosing.

This component will be graded on style of presentation, aesthetics,
representation of the data, and breakdown of the information for understanding
by lay people.
