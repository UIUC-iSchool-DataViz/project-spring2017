### Part 4: Narrative Report Around a Dataset

* ##### Approach

	We chose IMLS data for our infographic. The dataset was very practical with approach. It was very interesting to see, how the trends were changing with grants. We also covered the recent budget problems with the data, such as decreased funding every year.

* ##### Strengths of our approach

	There is a bigger narrative in our infograph, because we are trying to account for the recent funding problems. The narrative is that funding for IMLS should not be cut, because of the numerous benefits it gives to the communities.
    
* ##### Weaknesses of our approach

	We could not find the dataset, from which we could have obtained more insights.

* ##### Things we wish to have done
	
	If we had gathered more information about the dataset, we would have shared more insights about the data.
