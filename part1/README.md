# LIS 590 Data Visualization Spring 2017 
## Component 1

This is the folder for Component 1 of *Group Summer*.

Including an ipython notebook of the source codes, a pdf file of all the data visualizations, and several data files.

## Requirement: Procedural, Bespoke Visualization

**Concept**: Tell us about the routes in the Champaign-Urbana Metro Transit
District.

Your first dataset will be based on the [CUMTD](http://cutmd.com/) data.  There
are several feeds available.  A copy of an example feed will be provided in
this repository; you should also feel free to scrape at regular intervals.
Data sources can be found at http://developer.cumtd.com/ .  In particular,
check the [GTFS](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference/) data
feed, which is provided in zipfile form (and updated with regularity.)

Your visualization should be constructed in a procedural way, and should be
suitable for static viewing.  (i.e., it should be non-interactive.)

A few of the possible concepts to explore are listed below; please note that
these should be considered starter points, and you should explore beyond them.

 * How quickly do buses go?  How does this vary based on time of day, region,
   route, etc?
 * How many stops are there?  What is their density?
 * How many buses are there on each route?  Does this correlate with stop
   density?

Generate from this a single PDF or PNG.
